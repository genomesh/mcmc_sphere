# Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) on high-dimensional spheres

For my Master's dissertation, supervised by [Professor Tim Sullivan][2], I investigated MCMC algorithms in high-dimensions both in Euclidean space and on spheres. This closely follows the paper [Dimension-independent Markov chain Monte Carlo on the sphere][1] by H.C. Lie, D. Rudolf, B. Sprungk and T.J. Sullivan.

This repo contains my dissertation, 6 MCMC algorithms and code to analyse and plot the output of MCMC algorithms. It also contains 3 examples of Bayesian density estimation. If you are interested in this work please don't hesitate to get in contact.

Finally, I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Tim J. Sullivan for his time, expertise and patience.
